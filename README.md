# Mojito

Mojito is a system for tying together bits of functionality into a working HTTP server.  It draws inspiration from [Chain](http://github.com/hassox/chain/), [fab](http://github.com/jed/fab/), and many other libraries.

Mojito adds minty sugar to the potent kick of [nodejs](http://github.com/ry/node/)'s powerful HTTP server.  Serve over ice.

Things are in a very experimental state at the moment.  There are some examples in the examples folder, but they might not all work.  If you check the date of the last commit above, and it's a long time ago, then maybe I abandoned it.  If it's recent, then things are changing, and you should stay tuned.
